# Vulnerability Test

## Overview
This repository contains the python code for the classification of network traffic data using LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) with 
CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model. The supervised machine learning model classifies the network traffic records as Normal or Anomalous.

## Dataset
The CSIC 2010 Web Application Attacks dataset, consisting of 61,065 instances and 17 features, is chosen for its representation
of real-world network traffic scenarios. 
The dataset is available on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ispangler/csic-2010-web-application-attacks?select=csic_database.csv

## Requirements
If running in a local environment, the following command can be used to install the required packages:
  
  pip install -r requirements.txt

## Sections
